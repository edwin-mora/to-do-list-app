# to-do-list-app
I created a quick To-Do List application. The user can add and remove items, as well as strike through items from the list when completed a task. The items in the list can also be moved around

This app was built as part of the Full-Stack Web Development Course. The purpose of the app was to get comfortable with the use of jQuery.
